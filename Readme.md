# Single Precision Converter (IEEE 754 - 32 Bit)

This project is a Java-based desktop application designed to convert decimal numbers into IEEE 754 single-precision (32-bit) floating-point representation. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing to visualize the conversion process.

## Features

- Converts decimal numbers to IEEE 754 single-precision format (32-bit).
- Displays sign, exponent, and mantissa components separately.
- Interactive Java Swing-based GUI for a user-friendly experience.
- Real-time calculation and visual representation of conversion.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for logic and calculations.
- **Swing**: GUI framework for creating interactive desktop applications.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ApoorvaKarvariya/SinglePrecision.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SinglePrecision
   ```

3. **Compile and Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   javac SinglePrecisionConverter.java
   java SinglePrecisionConverter
   ```

4. **Convert a Number**:
   - Enter a decimal number in the provided input field.
   - Click the "Convert" button to see its IEEE 754 single-precision representation.
